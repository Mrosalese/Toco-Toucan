# Toco-Toucan

## Client requests:

+ Change the color on all links to #db531f.
+ When hovering over any link make sure it has an underline.
+ Change the list under "More About the Toucan" to have bullets instead of numbers. 

## Issues to fix:

+ Something is wrong with the logo. We added styles in the CSS file for it to be a certain width, but in the browser it isn't smaller. Can you fix it?
